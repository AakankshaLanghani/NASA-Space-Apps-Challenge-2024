## 🌊 Climate Story: Glacial Crisis in Southeast Greenland

### Project Overview

This project aims to raise awareness about climate change through data-driven storytelling focused on the glacial crisis in Southeast Greenland. By leveraging NASA's open data and advanced visualization techniques, we have developed an interactive dashboard that highlights the impact of rising temperatures on glacier ice loss and its implications for global sea levels.

### Key Features

- **🖥️ Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Visualize annual and seasonal glacier ice discharge, freshwater data, and cumulative ice loss in an engaging format.

- **📊 Data Sources:**  
  Integrates satellite data from NASA, USGS, and Copernicus to provide a comprehensive analysis of glacial dynamics.

- **🔍 Insights:**  
  Offers user-friendly exploration of the relationship between glacier melt, fjord salinity, and freshwater flux.

- **📖 Data Story Website:**  
  Navigate our dedicated website featuring engaging narratives supported by data, contextualizing the significance of our findings and the urgency for climate action.

### Objectives

- **📚 Educate:**  
  Inform users about the accelerating impacts of climate change on glaciers.

- **🌱 Encourage Action:**  
  Inspire collective efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

- **🔬 Support Research:**  
  Provide a platform for further analysis and research on glacial dynamics.
